            professional help, accessing therapy, and joining support groups.

        <h2>Information on managing stress, anxiety, and depression</h2>
        <div class="Resources">Managing stress, anxiety, and depression is crucial for maintaining mental well-being.
            Stress often arises from various pressures in life, such as work, relationships, or financial concerns.
            Effective stress management involves identifying stressors and adopting coping strategies like time
            management, relaxation techniques, and seeking social support.
            Similarly, anxiety, characterized by excessive worry and fear, can be managed through cognitive-behavioral
            techniques, mindfulness practices, and professional therapy if needed. Depression, a mood disorder that
            affects mood, thoughts, and physical health, requires a multifaceted approach involving therapy, medication,
            lifestyle changes, and support networks.
            Regular exercise, sufficient sleep, and engaging in hobbies can also contribute significantly to alleviating
            symptoms of anxiety and depression.</div>

        <h2>Techniques for mindfulness and meditation</h2>
        <div class="Resources">Mindfulness and meditation are practices that promote mental clarity, focus, and emotional balance.
            Mindfulness involves being fully present in the moment, acknowledging thoughts and feelings without
            judgment. Techniques include mindful breathing, body scan meditations, and mindful eating, which help reduce
            stress and improve overall well-being.
            Meditation, on the other hand, encompasses various practices such as guided meditation, mantra meditation,
            and loving-kindness meditation.
            These techniques encourage relaxation, reduce anxiety, and enhance self-awareness. Regular practice of
            mindfulness and meditation can cultivate resilience to stressors, improve concentration, and foster a
            greater sense of inner peace.</div>
